For example:\n\n```js\nfs.src(['!b*.js', '*.js'])\n```\n\nwould not exclude any files, but this would\n\n```js\nfs.src(['*.js', '!b*.js'])\n```\n\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is where the glob begins if any.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()` if there is no glob.\n\n  - buffer - `true` or `false` if you want to buffer the file.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n    - `false` will make `file.contents` a paused Stream.\n\n  - read - `true` or `false` if you want the file to be read or not. Useful for stuff like `rm`ing files.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n    - `false` will disable writing the file to disk via `.dest()`.\n\n  - since - `Date` or `number` if you only want files that have been modified since the time specified.\n  - stripBOM - `true` or `false` if you want the BOM to be stripped on UTF-8 encoded files.\n    - Default value is `true`.\n\n  - passthrough - `true` or `false` if you want a duplex stream which passes items through and emits globbed files.\n    - Default is `false`.\n\n  - sourcemaps - `true` or `false` if you want files to have sourcemaps enabled.\n    - Default is `false`.\n    - Will load inline sourcemaps and resolve sourcemap links from files\n    - Uses `gulp-sourcemaps` under the hood\n\n  - followSymlinks - `true` if you want to recursively resolve symlinks to their targets; set to `false` to preserve them as symlinks.\n    - Default is `true`.\n    - `false` will make `file.symlink` equal the original symlink's target path.\n\n  - Any glob-related options are documented in [glob-stream] and [node-glob].\n\n- Returns a Readable stream by default, or a Duplex stream if the `passthrough` option is set to `true`.\n- This stream emits matching [vinyl] File objects.\n\n_Note:_ UTF-8 BOM will be stripped from all UTF-8 files read with `.src`.\n\n### dest(folder[, opt])\n- Takes a folder path as the first argument.\n- First argument can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is the `cwd` resolves to the folder path.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n\n  - mode - Specify the mode the files should be created with.\n    - Default is the mode of the input file (file.stat.mode) if any.\n    - Default is the process mode if the input file has no mode property.\n\n  - dirMode - Specify the mode the directory should be created with.\n    - Default is the process mode.\n\n  - overwrite - Specify if existing files with the same path should be overwritten or not.\n    - Default is `true`, to always overwrite existing files.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns `true` or `false`.\n\n  - sourcemaps -\n    - Default is `null` aka do not write sourcemaps.\n    - Uses `gulp-sourcemaps` under the hood\n    - Examples:\n      - Write as inline comments\n      - fs.dest('./', {sourcemaps: true})\n      - Write as files in the same folder\n      - fs.dest('./', {<br>  sourcemaps: {<br>    path: '.'<br>  }<br>})\n      - Any other options are passed through to `gulp-sourcemaps`\n      - fs.dest('./', {<br>  sourcemaps: {<br>    path: '.',<br>    addComment: false,<br>    includeContent: false<br>  }<br>})\n\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will save the [vinyl] File to disk at the folder/cwd specified.\n- After writing the file to disk, it will be emitted from the stream so you can keep piping these around.\n- If the file has a `symlink` attribute specifying a target path, then a symlink will be created.\n- The file will be modified after being written to this stream:\n  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.\n  - `stat.mode` will be overwritten if you used a mode parameter.\n  - `contents` will have it's position reset to the beginning if it is a stream.\n\n### symlink(folder[, opt])\n- Takes a folder path as the first argument.\n- First argument can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n- Possible options for the second argument:\n  - cwd - Specify the working directory the folder is relative to.\n    - Default is `process.cwd()`.\n\n  - base - Specify the folder relative to the cwd. This is used to determine the file names when saving in `.dest()`.\n    - Default is the `cwd` resolves to the folder path.\n    - Can also be a function that takes in a file and returns a folder path.\n\n  - dirMode - Specify the mode the directory should be created with.\n    - Default is the process mode.\n\n- Returns a Readable/Writable stream.\n- On write the stream will create a symbolic link (i.e. symlink) on disk at the folder/cwd specified.\n- After creating the symbolic link, it will be emitted from the stream so you can keep piping these around.\n- The file will be modified after being written to this stream:\n  - `cwd`, `base`, and `path` will be overwritten to match the folder.\n\n[glob-stream]: https://github.com/gulpjs/glob-stream\n[node-glob]: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob\n[gaze]: https://github.com/shama/gaze\n[glob-watcher]: https://github.com/gulpjs/glob-watcher\n[vinyl]: https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-fs\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/vinyl-fs.svg\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/vinyl-fs\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/vinyl-fs.svg?branch=master\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/wearefractal/vinyl-fs\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/wearefractal/vinyl-fs.svg?style=flat\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/gulpjs/vinyl-fs\n[depstat-image]: https://david-dm.org/gulpjs/vinyl-fs.svg\n",
